## **Algorithms and Techniques Used**

1. **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)**

   * Balances the imbalanced fraud dataset.
   * Generates synthetic examples for the minority class.

2. **Random Forest Classifier**

   * Ensemble method combining multiple decision trees.
   * Reduces variance and improves prediction accuracy.
   * Provides feature importance for business interpretability.

3. **Grid Search Cross-Validation**

   * Hyperparameter tuning to optimise `mtry` for Random Forest.
   * Uses 5-fold cross-validation for robust performance estimation.

4. **Evaluation Metrics**

   * Confusion Matrix: Precision, Recall, F1-score.
   * ROC Curve and AUC for model discrimination capability.

5. **Probability Threshold Analysis**

   * Extracts transactions with the highest fraud probability.
   * Generates business-ready risk ranking reports.
